# cnamer

Redirect domains using just a CNAME.

Documentation @ [cnamer.com](http://cnamer.com).

To deploy: PHP + wildcard DNS that forwards everything to cnamer.php except for
the index, that goes to index.html, if you want an index that is.

# future

- A nice idea would be to offer txt records alongside cnames
